# Subscription Packages Testing Framework

The framework tests the subscription packages on the STC TV website by validating the type, price, and currency for three different countries. I used Selenium for web automation, Java as the programming language, TestNG for testing, and Maven for project management.


## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

    git clone ["https://github.com/AhmedGamal991/Validate_Subscription.git"]
   


3. **Set up your environment**:
    - Ensure you have Java installed.
    - Install Selenium and any other dependencies required by the framework.

- **Running Tests**:
    - Use the provided scripts or commands to run tests.
    - Example command:
        ```bash
        mvn test
   
    - Build the project and download dependencies using Maven:

        ```bash
        mvn clean install
- **Writing Tests**:
    - I Created and modify test cases as needed in the `src\test\java\tests` directory.
    - I Created a XML file that inclouded test suit for the contries
